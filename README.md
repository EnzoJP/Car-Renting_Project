# Car-Renting-App-Project 🚗

A client-server Spring Boot application for car rentals. This repository contains a backend server and two separate web clients (administrative and promotional) that demonstrate a RESTful API, file uploads, and typical rental workflows.

Each module includes a Maven wrapper. From the module folder run (Windows PowerShell):

- Server:
  - cd `Servidor`
  - ./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

- Admin client:
  - cd `ClienteAdmin`
  - ./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
